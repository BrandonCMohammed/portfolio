                        Hi, I'm Brandon Mohammed and I am a software developer from Trinidad and Tobago. 
                        I have graduated from the University of the West Indies with a BSc in Computer Science and Physics.
                        {/* <hr/> */}

                   

                

                    I have experience in Web Development, UI design and Database Design.
                    In my current position, I am being trained in Enterprise Architecture and Developer Operations. 
                    {/* <hr/> */}

                

                    I am a passionate, creative and patient person who loves to problem solve. Some of my hobbies that show this is my passion for speed cubing and music.
                    I am a quick learner and honest. I pay attention to details which allows me to plan and stay well organized. I am a team player and my 
                    communication skills as well as open mindedness and flexability aid me in working with teams. Due to me experience working under an Enterprise Architecture team,
                    this has allowed me to develop a business prespective to go along with my technical mindset.
